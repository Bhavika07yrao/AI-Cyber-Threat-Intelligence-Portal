# 🛡 AI Cyber-Threat Intelligence Portal

An enterprise-style Cyber Threat Intelligence Dashboard that simulates real-time monitoring of emerging cyber threats, classifies risk using an AI-based scoring engine, and visualizes security trends in a professional SOC-style interface.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The AI Cyber-Threat Intelligence Portal is a fully frontend-based web application that simulates a Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard. 

It automatically generates cyber threat events, calculates severity using a risk scoring algorithm, and displays insights through dynamic charts and a live threat log.

This project demonstrates:

- Real-time data simulation
- AI-style risk classification logic
- Interactive dashboard design
- Dynamic visual analytics
- Professional cybersecurity UI/UX

## 🔥 Core Features

### 📊 Live Dashboard
- Total Threat Counter
- Critical Alert Counter
- Industries Impacted Counter
- Dynamic Threat Distribution (Pie Chart)
- Threat Growth Trend (Line Chart)

### 🤖 AI Risk Scoring Engine
Each threat is scored using:
- Threat Type Base Weight
- Industry Sensitivity Weight
- Volatility Factor

Severity Levels:
- Low
- Medium
- High
- Critical

### 📑 Threat Log
- Real-time updating log
- Filter by Threat Type
- Filter by Severity
- Risk Score visibility
- Timestamp tracking

### 🧠 AI Insight Panel
Automatically generates intelligence summaries based on latest threat activity.

## 🏗 How It Works

Every few seconds:

1. A simulated cyber threat is generated.
2. Risk score is calculated.
3. Severity level is assigned.
4. Dashboard metrics update.
5. Charts refresh dynamically.
6. AI insight text updates.

No backend required. Fully deployable on GitHub Pages.
